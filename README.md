### Testbed setup
2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 @ 2.60GHz CPUs (each with 24 logical cores under Hyper-threading and 32k/256k/30720K L1- 3 caches), and two Intel 82599ES dual-port 10-Gbps NICs spread over two NUMA nodes. The server runs Ubuntu 16.04.1 with Linux 4.15.0-58-generic kernel. We adjusted the CPU frequency scaling governor to ``performance" and disabled Turboboost to reduce performance variance.
